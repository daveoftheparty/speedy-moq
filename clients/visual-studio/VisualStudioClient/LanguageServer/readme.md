This folder exists so that we can reference it in a build file, the contents of the folder other than this readme are generated by a command similar to the following:

```
dotnet build ^
	-c Release ^
	server/OmniLsp/OmniLsp.csproj ^
	/property:GenerateFullPaths=true ^
	/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary ^
	--output <this folder>
```
