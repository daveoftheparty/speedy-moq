First, this **is not** the readme that the client will see when browsing the Extension Marketplace... at least, I hope not.

That readme will go under the client folder, I believe...

Secondly, this code was originally copied from github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples.git

And then I'm going to heavily borrow from both:
1) https://github.com/bjorkstromm/lsp-example.git (also see his original [blog post](https://martinbjorkstrom.com/posts/2018-11-29-creating-a-language-server))
2) https://github.com/natanfudge/Auto-Using.git (less so this one, but will use some patterns to find server DLL etc)


Thirdly, I love the way Martin Björkström (the blog poster from #1 above) simplified his file/directory structure to simply just be ./Client and ./Server, but I don't understand enough yet about the locations of all the "magic" files so... I'll stick with the messier Microsoft example for now.
